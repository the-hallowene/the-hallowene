<p>Skip to content 🇦🇺 public holidays 2020, 2021 australia dates 🇦🇺 The department of tourism (dot) is now investigating a halloween party in boracay that allegedly flouted social distancing rules. * keep 1.5 metres apart * practise hand hygiene * stay home and get tested if unwell * wear a face mask if unable to physically distance if you plan to hand out treats: Halloween rules depend on where you live. A final decision on halloween in victoria is likely to be made next week.</p>
