<p>Use chicken wire for the form and old clothes for the stuffing to make them look like real witches. You can buy the spiders online or make them at home. These eyeballs are perfect for creating a creepy atmosphere especially when they are displayed on trees that line a long driveway or walking path. Is it cheery or creepy? Halloween is meant to be fun and outrageous, so why not do something different, like adding a spooky, kooky tree to your halloween decor?</p>
