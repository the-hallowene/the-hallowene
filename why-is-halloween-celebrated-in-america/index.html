<p>Halloween is one of many holidays in america that have changed quite a bit from its origins. However, la toussaint, also known in english as all saints day, is a widely celebrated national holiday in france. Despite having its roots in the celtic cultures of europe, halloween in france is not a traditional holiday and actually came from north america in the 1990s. Halloween (as we know it today) wasn’t always celebrated in the united states, but it has certainly become an important part of our culture and we take it way beyond trick or treating with our halloween gifts! In christian times, it became a celebration of the evening before all saints’ day.</p>
