I can not believe we are halfway through october already which means half term is almost upon us and then halloween! Show other films in the series to make it a complete marathon of these great kids’ halloween movies. Or a horror movie that won’t necessarily send you scrambling beneath the covers, with a 6,000 watt night light plugged in? This year i am hoping to make a bit of a thing about halloween we have a couple of parties planned and they both have dressing up outfits already brought.</p>
