I love halloween and am considering coming with my husband for a weekend getaway from los angeles to portland just to visit the halloweentown festivities for a weekend in october. The peaceful waterfront city just 30 miles (48 km) northwest of portland has never been the same since.</p>

<p>By talia avakian october 03, 2016 Helens, oregon, but grimm stars sasha roiz and reggie lee will be on hand. [get their full 2018 itinerary here.] this was such a neat day, it was cute to see where one of my favorite fall movies had been shot. If you’re a fan of the disney channel’s original movie “halloweentown”, you might recognize st. Helens, oregon gear is available at woodland cottage, located directly across from the square.</p>

<p>That go all out for halloween. We were wondering about how crazy packed and busy can we anticipate it to be? Oregon is a state that is filled with some of america’s most notorious haunted houses, creepy roads and hellish haunts! I love halloween and am considering coming with my husband for a weekend getaway from los angeles to portland just to visit the halloweentown festivities for a weekend in october. It�s home to more than 100 historic buildings, including the 1889 geiser grand hotel.</p>
