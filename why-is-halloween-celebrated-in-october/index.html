Halloween might look slightly different this year since we are still in the midst of a global pandemic, but we can reminisce on years past. Alla helgons dag is what halloween is called in sweden.

<p>Halloween can be traced back to an ancient celtic holiday called samhain, celebrated in what is now ireland, scotland, and england, as well as parts of northern europe. It has always been celebrated on the 31, the day before the christian observance of all soul�s day. The filipinos regard november 1 as the day of the dead and observe it on a grand scale. The day, celebrated on november 1, marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the cold and dark wintertime, often associated with death. Halloween is celebrated on 31st october every year.</p>
