Children of any age and ability can have a safe, fun halloween that will not break the bank or make them feel as though they are missing out on any activities this year. Halloween in covid 19 times wouldn’t be complete without decorations. The neighbours were keen, there was a primary school across the road, and it was going to be big.</p>

<p>Andy leyden of penetangore row, kincardine, has created a very timely halloween display. As a good sociologist, i went for a walk and then a drive around the neighborhood to answer the question. The neighbours were keen, there was a primary school across the road, and it was going to be big. People were certainly putting out plenty of lively decorations. Halloween in covid 19 times wouldn’t be complete without decorations.</p>
