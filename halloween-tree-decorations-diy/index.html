Of course, it’s always hard for me to throw anything away, so when i second guessed myself about these branches i thought they were eerie enough to make a simple halloween tree for my decorations this year. This would work really well with a lighted tree but you could use one that’s not as well.</p>

<p>I wanted to share some more of my easy diy halloween decorations you can make this weekend. Of course, it’s always hard for me to throw anything away, so when i second guessed myself about these branches i thought they were eerie enough to make a simple halloween tree for my decorations this year. You see, one of the best things about halloween decorations is that you can get away with minimal diy skills &amp; using cheap materials! The china hutch has a few diy halloween crafts, but my favorite are the lanterns sitting on the top right. They only require 2 steps and a few minutes to make so this is a cool project to do with your kids.</p>

<p>Grab a cheap plastic skull at dollar tree, and turn it into a real work of art. They only require 2 steps and a few minutes to make so this is a cool project to do with your kids. Halloween trees can be a part of the festive decor or a centerpiece on your table. For each cat, cut three pieces of black waxed twine, about 4. Just add store bought or diy halloween decorations like paper plate pumpkins and anything else that you can find to decorate it.</p>
