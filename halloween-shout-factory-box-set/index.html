<p>Anchor bay will primarily be releasing the box sets. Yes, there so good, it is actually upsetting. Never thought i�d say that about a scream factory sale! Considering the rights to various entries lie with different studios, it seemed highly unlikely a complete halloween box set would ever be made available. Michael is coming home… we just now received the full press release featuring all of the specs for anchor bay entertainment and scream factory’s september 23 release of the halloween complete.</p>

<p>Shout factory will be in charge of the special features for the release. Only the first couple movies have ever been watched so the disc are in excellent condition. Shipped with usps priority mail. The good folks at anchor bay and scream factory have joined forces to create the closest thing to a definitive halloween box set we’re ever likely to get, including all 8 of the movies spawned from john carpenter’s classic original and both of rob zombie’s reboot efforts. Is the box set released by anchor bay or shout factory?</p>
