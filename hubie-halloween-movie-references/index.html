<p>Hubie halloween is a 2020 comedy horror film released by netflix. Hubie halloween is one of sandler’s better netflix. On halloween night an escaped mental patient, and possibly a werewolf as well, as loose in the town and hubie, the self proclaimed halloween monitor, takes it upon himself to save everyone. There�s no question that hubie halloween is another massive hit for adam sandler on netflix, and many fans are praising it for the nostalgic references to his previous films, but it also had a. Less of a movie and more of a collection of fart noises and funny voices, hubie halloween is simultaneously everything that’s great and awful about the last decade of sandler’s career.</p>

<p>A crude sexual conversation of a character having a boner in math class two teens are briefly shown kissing at a party; Hubie is an object of local ridicule, and a frequent target for eggs, flaming bags of poop, and rocks from the town kids. There were really fun references to older, far superior adam sandler movies. Sandler plays hubie, a nerdy man with a speech impediment. I’ll say a couple things i loved.</p>

<p>Hubie halloween is great for those that want to get into the spirit of the spooky season but don’t want to commit to a horror film. By far the best is ben stiller’s return as the orderly hal. More than a passable holiday comedy, though hubie halloween succeeded in tapping into the tradition of sandler films. Unfortunately, the town doesn’t love him nearly as much: The jokes aren’t often sandler’s best material but hubie halloween is as sweet and easily digestible as a milky way.</p>

People are always making fun of him for no reason. Adapted from mary shelley’s iconic text, 1931’s frankenstein and its 1935 sequel bride of frankenstein both earn a shout out from this sandler vehicle. The concept of a comedic horror movie from adam sandler is undoubtedly refreshing and welcoming. Hubie loves halloween, but he’s easily scared.</p>
