<p>With isaiah griffin, rachel ham, tyler hoechlin, murray phillips. I hope you enjoy it. Come one come all come join right in the halloween party�s about to begin! This disney halloween song was first featured in winnie the pooh and the blustery day, the 1968 disney film featurette. Performed by the book of mormon’s josh gad, it’s funny to watch a snowman imagining what it is like to be in summer and singing a happy tune to it.</p>
