<p>Spirit airlines is the leading ultra low cost carrier in the united states, the caribbean and latin america. It has rolled out “fogging” treatments to disinfect the interiors of its fleet, including one with an “antimicrobial product” that the airline says kills bacteria and viruses on contact for up to 30 days. By the way this is the first time i have ever done a review for anything. If i could give 0 stars, i would. It’s also a good fit for the airline, given the reputation they have for offering a fun and quirky experience.</p>
