<p>As i wrote about in the september full moon meaning post, september and october’s full moons are a bit different than other months.most full moons coincide with the month they land in. However, the full moon that is closest to the autumn equinox is considered the harvest moon.typically the harvest moon lands in september, but occasionally it lands in october. Specifically, it is sometimes representative of the elder years, once a woman has passed far beyond the status of early cronehood; But that’s not the only thing that makes this october special. The older meaning defines a blue moon as the third full moon in a season that has four full moons.</p>

<p>This blue moon, occurring on halloween, when the spiritual veil between our two worlds is the thinnest, marks a time of tremendous positive growth in your personal life. This rare calendar event only occurs every few years, giving rise to the term “once in a blue moon“. A “blue moon” is a fairly infrequent phenomenon involving the appearance of an additional full moon within one month. I believe fear has been largely embedded into the holiday simply because with thinner veils and heightened intuition comes fear of the unknown. The second full moon of this month is going to grace the sky on october 31 i.e.</p>

<p>Blue moon ritual tools include two bowls, two pieces of paper, a pen, fire from a candle, and a cup of water. Samhain is directly across from beltane on the wheel of the year… There are roughly 29.5 days between full moons, making it. Saturday’s blue moon is all the more spectacular because it is the last blue moon to rise until the night of halloween in 2020. This celtic celebration is also known as samhain.</p>

<p>If a member of the family dies during a blue moon, three more will follow. This rare calendar event only occurs every few years, giving rise to the term “once in a blue moon“. Opposing energies that you can very well bring together and use in your favor. During a new moon, the moon is roughly sitting between the earth &amp; the sun, hence the sun is shining on the ‘dark side of the moon’, the side of the moon we. Since a full moon is symbolic of culmination, completion, and fruition, a blue moon in aquarius will be one impressing your inner worlds with individuality, rebellion, and a concern for the world.</p>
